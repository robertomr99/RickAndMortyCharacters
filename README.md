# Rick And Morty Characters

"Simple App that retrieves data from the Rick and Morty API, showcasing an implementation of some of the best practices in Android development. This includes:

* MVVM for promotes a clear separation of concerns between an application's user interface (UI), data management, and functional logic.
* ViewModel for efficient management and preservation of user interface-related data.
* LiveData to create observable data streams that safely notify the UI of changes in data.
* Hilt for dependency injection, enhancing code modularity and testability.
* Kotlin Coroutines for seamless and efficient handling of asynchronous operations.
* Retrofit for structured and effective API requests.
* Navigation for a smooth and cohesive user experience.

This application serves as a practical example of how to apply these technologies and best practices in Android app development, making it a valuable reference for developers looking to create high-quality Android applications."
